<span class="fs70">THE OUTLOOK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When a business reaches the billion dollar
mark per year, it is generally looked into by
thinking people who like to know the facts of
the case, and who want to know just why the
business has reached such large proportions.
In this little booklet I will endeavor to explain
not only why the poultry business has grown
so rapidly, but will also reveal the most important
secrets that have contributed largely
to its rapid growth, so that whether the reader
is a farmer, a town lot fancier, or a student of
economics, he or she will gain much by the
reading and the studying of the principles involved.</p>

<p>The high cost of living has forced many
people to economize to the limit, and reduce
the family budget to the minimum. People in
the small towns and villages, especially, have
sought various ways of increasing their earnings,
and one of the most popular methods resorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
to has been to raise a few chickens, thus
utilizing the table scraps, and odds and ends,
so that there will be no waste. It has been
proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that chickens
can be raised profitably by the person living
in town, as well as by the farmer with his
vast acres, providing the townsman knows a
few essential principles in regard to the proper
handling of the birds.</p>

<p>Poultry products are becoming popular more
than ever before. This is due in part to the
increased price of beef and pork. Eggs are
an established part of the nation’s menu, while
the meat of the chicken is now within the
means of most American families. Since these
facts are recognized, there has been a revolution
in the poultry industry itself to cope with
the increased demand for eggs, meat, and breeding
stock.</p>

<p>Many city people have taken advantage of
the opportunity of raising chickens, and many
an old packing box, or piano box has been relieved
of its original purpose of encasing furniture,
or other articles, and has done its bit
to act as part of a shelter for housing some
back-yard lot of chickens. What has been done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
can be done, and inasmuch as the value of the
egg, or the carcass of the bird still maintains
its high standard on the market, it stands to
reason that the poultry industry is still in its
infancy. Much more will be done in the future
than has been done in the past.</p>

<p>Consequently, there is still one industry that
is not overcrowded, despite the great number
who have taken it up, either as a vocation, or
as an avocation. When it is considered that
New York City alone cannot get enough eggs
to supply the demand during the fall and winter
months, and is willing to pay, and pay dearly
for breakfast eggs, and that the vicinity of
Pataluma, Cal., finds it profitable to ship its
eggs across the continent to put them on the
New York market, it can be seen quite clearly
that there are excellent possibilities in poultry,
even in just a small back yard flock.</p>

<p>The remainder of this booklet will be devoted
to showing the ordinary layman, who has had
no previous knowledge or experience, how he
can take a small flock, or a large flock, and
turn it into pleasure and profit. However,
one word of caution is necessary. Let no one
attempt to venture upon a poultry enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
on a big scale at first. History has shown
countless failures in such attempts, and history
has a way of repeating itself. It is always
wiser to start moderately, and work into it
gradually. This method always proves successful
if common sense and moderation are
exhibited.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE POULTRY BREEDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before attempting to discuss the methods of
raising poultry it is deemed advisable to first
take up a discussion of the different breeds and
their characteristics. Outside of a few fancy
breeds, that are raised more for curiosity or
show purposes, we usually think of the breeds
of poultry as three distinct classes.</p>

<p>The first of these three classes that we will
take up for discussion is what is termed the
egg breed. This breed is usually represented
by such birds as the Leghorn, Ancona, Campine,
Minorca, or the Houdan. Of these five
breeds, the Leghorn and the Minorca are by
far the most popular. There are different varieties
of all these breeds, but the White Leghorn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and the Black Minorca are much more popular
in their respective breeds than are any other
variety. The other breeds are found scattered
here and there, but the Leghorn and Minorca
are easily the leading egg breeds. Both of
these breeds have many birds with yearly records
of over 300 eggs per year. Next let us
consider a few of the important characteristics
of these egg breeds.</p>

<p>These breeds are small, light of weight, very
active, and very hard to confine in a small inclosure.
The average adult bird of these breeds
weighs about four pounds. They are neat and
attractive in appearance, have clean shanks, and
have large head parts, which are much more
susceptible to being frosted in cold weather,
than the other breeds.</p>

<p>The egg production of the egg breed is of
the best. As has been stated, there are a great
number of birds in this class that have records
of over 300 eggs per year. Their eggs are
white shelled, of good size, and rather long.
However the meat of these birds, especially
when matured, is very tough, and the active
disposition of the egg breeds do not allow
them to put on surplus flesh as with the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
class of birds. Quick maturity is characteristic
of the egg breeds, however, and because of this
fact, they make excellent small broilers when
but a few months old. But it is useless to put
them on the market for meat when mature, as
they will not fatten like the heavier breeds.</p>

<p>The disposition of these breeds, as has been
said, is active, nervous, and hard to confine.
Therefore, for the person with a small lot on
which to raise chickens, it would be well to
choose a heavier breed that stands confinement
better than these breeds. These birds are
active in the house in winter, or on the range
in summer, and owing to their natural tendency
to roam, they are always uneasy when confined
to a small yard. They also have excellent
powers of flight, and can usually fly over
a fence unless the fence is about eight feet
high.</p>

<p>The egg breed, owing to the activity so characteristic
to such breeds, makes poor sitters
and mothers. It is very seldom that a fowl of
these breeds can content herself to sit on a
nest of eggs three weeks, which is the time
required to hatch the eggs. Their eggs are
usually hatched under a general purpose hen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
or with an incubator. They make poor mothers,
because they usually like to roam too far to
properly look after their young.</p>

<p>Another point in favor of the egg breeds,
however, is their early maturity. Usually these
birds will mature in close to four months. This
allows them plenty of time to get into laying
condition in the fall, before cold weather starts,
and birds that can lay eggs during the months
of November and December are certainly an
asset, as eggs always bring the highest prices
on the market during these two months.</p>

<p>These birds will live on less feed than any
other class because of their small size, and
their great foraging ability. However, these
breeds are not as hardy as the heavier breeds,
and will not stand the cold as well, because of
their lack of feathers, and large combs and
wattles. These large head parts are easily frost
bitten in cold weather, and when this happens
the birds generally stop laying until they have
recovered from the setback. With these few
words on the egg breed characteristics, let
us next consider the general purpose breed.</p>

<p>When we speak of general purpose breeds,
we usually mean one of four different breeds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
The Plymouth Rock, Rhode Island Red, Orpington,
and the Wyandotte are the four leading
breeds of this class. Then there are quite a
few different varieties of each of these four
breeds, such as the Barred Rock, the White
Rock, the Buff Rock, etc. These breeds are
very good both as egg birds, and for meat purposes,
and find favor where ever they go. I
will attempt to analyze their characteristics,
bringing out their strong points and their weak
points, as I have already done with the egg
breeds.</p>

<p>These breeds have been developed for egg
production, and as a result, have many birds in
the 300 egg class, as well as the strictly egg
breeds. If any are to be disposed of, they have
the ability to put on flesh and to bring a good
price on the market for meat. When one
realizes that usually one half of a hatch of
chickens are males, and the other half females,
it can be easily seen that the general purpose
bird has an advantage, in the sale of the male
birds, and of the surplus females, as they can
be fed fattening feeds, and a good profit made
from this source.</p>

<p>The general purpose birds make excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
mothers and sitters. They have a broody disposition,
and will set on the nest the required
three weeks to hatch the chickens. They will
also take care of their young as a parent should.
In fact, one of the criticisms of this class of
birds is that they are too broody, and are a
nuisance in this particular. They are far more
quiet than the egg breeds, and stand confinement
with no apparent discomforture. They
make an ideal bird for the back lot.</p>

<p>These birds are fairly good foragers, but
take a little more feed to maintain their upkeep
than do the egg breeds. They have smaller
head parts than the egg breeds, and a heavier
coating of flesh and feathers thus enabling
them to withstand cold weather much better
than the egg breeds.</p>

<p>These breeds, in most cases, have yellow
shanks, long well rounded bodies, and weigh
about six pounds at maturity. They are not as
nervous or as active as the egg breeds, but
require a month or two longer to mature and
to get into laying condition, than the egg
breeds.</p>

<p>We will close this discussion on breed characteristics
with a few words on the meat breeds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
There are four generally recognized meat
breeds. These are the Brahams, Cochins,
Langshans, and the Cornish Game, with their
several varieties. The adult meat bird usually
weighs about eight pounds, but the male birds
weigh even more than this, sometimes reaching
twelve pounds or more. These birds are
rather awkward and clumsy, in fact, so much so
that they make poor sitters, as their awkwardness
often causes them to break the eggs in
the nest. They have an abundance of feathers
and meat on their body, which makes them
easy to winter. Generally speaking, the heavier
the bird, the poorer the laying ability, and
this is true with the meat breeds. They do not
lay a very large number of eggs during the
year, being raised mostly for their flesh, which
is unsurpassed for table purposes. As is the
custom with heavy animals, the meat birds are
lazy and sluggish, do not roam far for their
food, and consume a comparatively large
amount of grain for this reason. The meat
breeds take a longer period of time to gain
maturity than any other class, the average time
being about eight months. As has been said,
they are primarily a meat breed, and it is for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
this purpose that they are mostly used. They
do lay eggs, however, and about 100 eggs per
year is a good average. They, like the general
purpose breed, lay a brown shelled egg, while
the egg breeds lay a white shelled egg, which
brings a higher price on every market in the
country but the Boston market. The brown
shelled egg brings the higher price on the
Boston market.</p>

<span class="fs70">GETTING A START</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have now discussed quite minutely the
good and bad points of the three main classes
of birds. Each class, and each breed has its
merits and demerits. The one who wants to
make a start in raising poultry should choose
the breed that appeals to his likes the most,
and the one that he can realize the most success
with, under the conditions that he will
have to raise them. There is no best breed,
whether it is chickens, cows, or hogs. They
all have their good points, and their weak ones.
It is up to each individual to pick the breed
that appeals to him the most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Granted that you have pretty near decided
the breed that you want to use, let us see how
we can secure our first birds, if we have none
as yet to start with. There are generally three
different ways in which we can secure our
foundation stock. The first way is by buying
adult birds and mating them, and raising the
resulting chicks. Another way is by purchasing
hatching eggs, either from a neighbor or
from a regular breeder or hatchery. The third
way is by buying day-old chicks from the various
hatcheries, and raising these to maturity.
Let us consider each of these methods separately,
and thereby inform ourselves on the
advantages and disadvantages of each method.</p>

<p>In selecting adult birds for breeding purposes,
and thus relying on these birds to produce
the hatching eggs, a few points are necessary
to bear in mind, if one wants the best
results. As these birds are to be the foundation
of your future flock, don’t buy them too
hastily, and also do not try to buy the cheapest
birds that you can find on the market, as you
usually get just what you pay for. Therefore,
the first thing to do is to look through poultry
papers, farm weeklies, etc., or to inquire locally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
from some neighboring breeder, and find out
just what it will cost you for adult females.
Having the desired breed in mind, it would be
advisable to post yourself on the qualifications,
and the disqualifications of this particular
breed. Standard weight for the breed is an
important consideration in this connection. If
the standard weight for an adult female is five
pounds, try to get females that weigh around
six pounds. These qualifications can be found
for every breed in the American Standard of
Perfection, a book published by the American
Poultry Association, and found in most libraries.
Another very important factor is the
health of the birds. No birds should be used
for breeding purposes that have ever had any
of the common poultry diseases, such as roup,
chicken pox, etc., as their resulting chicks will
also have a tendency toward this disease.
Select nothing but healthy, vigorous birds, of
standard weight and color, free from disease,
of good body conformation, and not less than
one year old. When pullets, or birds of less
than a year old, are used for breeding, the result
is a small egg, which hatches out a small,
under-sized chick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>If you can get in touch with your State College
of Agriculture, they can usually inform
you of some reliable breeder who can furnish
you with the kind of birds you want. In selecting
the cockerels, or male birds, one very
good way is to buy them from an unrelated
flock, and buy some that are especially strong
where the females are weak. For instance, if
the females that you have purchased are a
little light in color, it would be advisable to
secure males that are a little darker in color
than the standard calls for. It is never advisable
to mate more than ten females with one
male, because if more are mated, the fertility
of the eggs will suffer. Many successful breeders
even use two male birds with a pen of ten
females, alternating one male in the breeding
pen every other day. Thus the fertility of the
hatching egg is doubly assured.</p>

<p>A cheaper method of securing the foundation
stock is in buying the hatching eggs, but not
quite as satisfactory as the first method. These
eggs are usually sold by the sitting, amounting
to fifteen eggs, or by the hundred. When buying
by the sitting, one buys from a regular
breeder, and pays anywhere from $1.50 up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
as high as $50 per sitting. It is not advisable
for the beginner to pay either of these extremes,
but to plan to buy eggs not over $5
per setting. Then as you progress in the business,
you can purchase males to mate with
your females to gradually improve your flock.
This method necessitates the use of an incubator,
unless you can arrange with some friend
who will loan you the use of his incubator.
Of course, if you already have some mature
birds, even of a different breed, you can set
these eggs under these birds, when they become
broody in the spring, and secure even a
larger hatch than you can from the use of an
incubator. Generally, a mature bird can set
on about fifteen eggs, and hatch every fertile
egg in the sitting. A more detailed discussion
on incubation will be given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The third way that one can secure a start
in the poultry business, is by buying day-old
chicks. This is an industry that has grown by
leaps and bounds in the last few years. The
price generally charged for these day-old chicks
is twice as much as is charged for the hatching
eggs. A fair price for 100 day-old chicks is
from $15 to $20. Of course, the quality of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
chicks is inferior to the higher priced sittings
of eggs, but if one is not so particular as to
type and show purposes, this method is very
satisfactory. The day-old chick business is
founded upon the principle that it is not advisable
to feed the chick for the first forty-eight
hours of its life, because just before the
chick emerges from the shell, it absorbs the
remainder of the yolk of the egg, and it is exceedingly
dangerous to feed the chick any food
during that period, as the chick will be sure to
experience digestive troubles, if any thing besides
water and grit is given to the chicks for
the first two days. Therefore, these chicks
are placed in a well ventilated box and sent
by parcel post often as far as a thousand miles,
with no loss in mortality. For one that has
no incubator or mature hens, this offers a very
satisfactory method of starting out in the
chicken business. There are commercial hatcheries
all over the country that make a business
of purchasing hatching eggs from raisers of
purebred poultry, and hatching these eggs in
mammoth incubators, selling the chicks as soon
as hatched, in the manner described.</p>

<p>Thus, the one interested in getting a start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in poultry has an option on either of these
three ways. The local circumstances of the
purchaser will largely determine which method
will be the best. But which ever method is
used, let me caution you that too much care
can not be given in finding a source that is
perfectly honorable in their business dealings,
as there has been in the past a considerable
amount of unfair dealing on the part of some
dealers in the poultry business, but I am glad
to say that these people are fast being weeded
out, and the tendency is now for honest, upright
dealings in all three branches of the industry,
as the dishonest people have found that
their methods forced them out of the business.
Not everybody will be independent of the incubator,
however, so we will next discuss something
in regard to the commercial incubator,
also including and comparing the natural incubation
of the egg.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="fs70">INCUBATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In order to get a better idea of artificial incubation,
let us first examine a few facts concerning
the way in which the hen hatches her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
eggs in the natural process. The fertile egg
is hatched when the egg is subjected to a heat
over 100 degrees, F., for a period of about
twenty-one days. The mother hen, by setting
on the eggs for this period, will bring off her
hatch on the twenty-first day, if she has been
given ordinary care. Let us see what are the
principles involved in this natural incubation,
that we may the better understand the artificial
method of incubation.</p>

<p>When the hen first becomes broody, and
wants to sit, she might try to “steal her nest.”
This is another way of saying that she will try
to locate some secluded spot, and after she has
succeeded in laying a dozen or fifteen eggs,
she will then spend nearly her entire time on
the nest, until she proudly marches back to her
old haunts with a small clutch of chickens.</p>

<p>It is a natural instinct of most hens to become
broody in the spring of the year, to reproduce
their kind. A constant desire to sit
on the nest is a sure sign of broodiness. When
one has the eggs to put under the hen to hatch,
it is best first to try to secure a general purpose
bird for this method, as they have been
found the best, for reasons previously stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Now let us prepare a nest for the bird, so
that she will have a good opportunity to do her
best work. We can either partition off a part
of the chicken house, or we can fix up a nest
in another building entirely, such as a garage,
barn, or any other building that we may have
on the premises. Next let us take some soil,
and make a round nest, over a foot in diameter,
and four or five inches deep. Then we will
dig out the center of the nest, so as to make
it hollow in the middle, leaving at least two
inches depth in the center. Then we will cover
this earth with a few inches of cut straw, shavings,
or leaves, and press this covering down
to conform to the shape of the soil foundation.
We can now place our eggs for hatching
in the nest, and put the bird on them. However,
best results will be obtained if we wait
until towards evening before we place the bird
on the nest, as she will be more contented
then. Take the bird that you have chosen
and place her gently upon the nest of eggs.
If she is at all broody, she will be quite contented
when she feels the eggs underneath her,
and settle down to business at once. The hen
should spend practically all of the next three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
weeks upon the nest, the only time that she
should be allowed to leave being the short
time that she takes food and water twice a
day. Having a quiet place, and giving her
nourishment twice a day, she will be quite contented.
The hen does not need any special
ration during this time, other than one that is
fairly heating. Corn is excellent during this
period, supplemented with a few other grains,
such as oats, wheat, etc. A sufficient amount
of fresh water should be available, together
with some kind of green food, if possible, such
as cabbage or mangoes. The hatch will not be
endangered by the hen leaving the nest to eat.
In fact, it is beneficial to the eggs to be temporarily
cooled, at least once a day, while the
hen is off the nest for a while.</p>

<p>The hen has a habit of turning the eggs
under her every day, not only removing their
position from the center to the outside, and
vice versa, but also turning them over, so that
perhaps the part of the egg that was in contact
with the nest one day, will be in contact
with the hen’s body the next day. Or, in other
words, she turns it half way around. These
are all peculiarities that we have to imitate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
artificial incubation, if we would be successful.
Now that we have seen the process of the
natural method of incubation, let us see how
the ingenuity of man has successfully imitated
the mother hen, and made possible the
hatching of a far greater number of chicks than
the hen can naturally hatch.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are a great many
incubators on the market, some being made to
sell, and others being made to use. How shall
we determine the make to buy? That is not
the easiest question in the world, if one has
had no previous experience with incubators.
Do not necessarily buy the incubator that is
advertised the most. Sometimes incubator
companies have to advertise extensively to do
a sufficient volume of business. The safest
way to choose an incubator, if you really intend
to purchase one, is to get the advice of
some one who is using one, and has had success
with the machine that he has used. Some of
the cheaper makes have the trouble of too varying
a temperature, especially during the night.
If one has to arise five or six times a night
for three weeks to regulate the lamp to maintain
a constant temperature, then the incubator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is more bother than it is worth. Therefore,
find out the makes of incubators that are giving
satisfaction in your own community, if you
are intending to purchase one, and then send
for one of a similar make. However, if you
have not enough eggs to warrant purchasing
one, then try to arrange with someone to loan
you one, or to put your eggs in with some
of theirs, so as to eliminate this expense.</p>

<p>There are in general two types of incubators,
the hot water and the hot air, the latter being
quite the more popular of the two. There are
several different sizes of incubators, ranging from
a fifty egg capacity up to a thousand egg capacity
machine. An incubator with a hundred
egg capacity is usually sufficiently large enough
for the small poultry keeper. By running three
or four hatches during the same season, a good
number of chicks can be hatched.</p>

<p>There are a few requirements that must be
fulfilled to realize the best results from an
incubator. First and foremost, always follow
the instructions that come with the incubator.
The manufacturers of the incubator know more
about their incubator than you do. Another
thing that should be borne in mind is that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
must not expect every egg that is placed in the
incubator to produce a chick. A very good
hatch is about 75 per cent. Of course, this
varies considerably, ranging all the way from
nothing to as high as sometimes 100 per cent.
Usually one can reasonably expect as high as
a 60 per cent hatch, at least, and very often
it goes considerably higher, according to the
conditions under which it is run.</p>

<p>Moisture is a prime essential for the proper
running of an incubator, and this should be
provided for. If possible, arrange to run the
incubator in a cellar, or some damp place. This
can be aided, by sprinkling water on the floor,
etc. Care must be exercised in running the incubator
that fire is guarded against, and some
insurance companies make special provisions
in their policies for such occasions, and make
a slightly higher charge for their policies, because
of the danger.</p>

<p>Another essential condition for a successful
hatch with the incubator is proper ventilation.
Most machines are provided with something
for the admission of fresh air. It is also necessary
that the room containing the incubator be
aired frequently to admit fresh air, but not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
such a manner that the eggs will become
chilled, or that too much air will be admitted
so as to carry off the moisture. Most incubators
carry proper directions so as to provide
against this danger.</p>

<p>The third condition necessary for proper running
of the incubator is the maintenance of a
constant temperature. It is usually advisable
to have the temperature about 102 degrees F.
the first week, 103 degrees the second week,
and 104 degrees the third week. Any serious
deviation from 103 degrees will result in a poor
hatch.</p>

<p>Now, then we will conclude this chapter with
a few pointers on running the incubator during
the hatching period. It is always well to
run the incubator a day or two empty, so as to
get the idea of how to best maintain the required
temperature. Clean the lamp thoroughly
before running, and then during the hatch, always
tend to the lamp after the eggs have
been turned, and never before, because if the
hands are smeared with kerosene, some of this
is bound to be left on the shells, which will result
in a poor hatch. Do not allow the lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to be in a draft, and clean the wick every day,
so as to prevent the lamp from smoking.</p>

<p>After the first few days, the eggs should
be turned at least once a day, and even better,
twice a day. This is to imitate the mother hen,
who does this on the nest. If the eggs are not
turned, then the embryo of the chick will adhere
to the shell of the egg, and either die,
or be crippled beyond hope.</p>

<p>We must imitate the mother hen again in the
artificial incubation of chicks, in regard to
cooling. We saw in the previous chapter, how
the hen leaves her nest occasionally to take
food and water, with no ill effects on the hatch.
Likewise we must cool the eggs in the incubator.
This can usually best be accomplished
while turning the eggs. Five or ten minutes
a day are usually sufficient for the proper cooling,
unless it is near the end of the hatch,
when twenty or thirty minutes can be used
for this purpose with safety.</p>

<p>On the seventh and the fourteenth day, it is
a good plan to test the eggs in the incubator,
so that the infertile eggs may be removed.
This is done by a process known as candling.
Hold each egg up in front of a light and note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the appearance of the interior of the egg. This
can be done by making a hole in a box, that
will fit over a light or lamp, and then holding
the eggs up to the light, showing through the
hole, which should be in line with the flame.
If the egg appears clear, free from any dark
spots, then the egg can be taken out of the
incubator, as it is not fertile, and will not
hatch. However, if the egg shows a dark spot,
about the size of a bean, and you can detect
small blood vessels running from it, then you
may be assured that the egg is coming along in
good shape, and will hatch out in due time.</p>

<p>With these points well in mind, one will
have little difficulty in properly running an incubator,
providing he has a reliable machine
to begin with. Of the matters considered in
this chapter, probably the most important factor
of all is the constant maintenance of a uniform
temperature. Now, then, let us consider
that the chicks are pipping the shells and are
ready to start out in life. We will therefore
consider the care of the chicks in the next
chapter, until they are able to care for themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="fs70">BROODING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Whether we hatched the eggs by means of an
incubator, or bought the day-old chicks, if we
have no mother hen to care for the chicks
after they are hatched, we must take care of
them ourselves. This is called the brooding
period. Unless the hatch is quite late, which,
by the way, is not desirable, we will have to
arrange to supply some cheap, simple form of
artificial heat, to prevent the young chickens
from getting chilled. This is accomplished in
several different ways, but we will only discuss
the more common ways here.</p>

<p>There are several different makes of readymade
brooders on the market, but one can in
a few hours spare time, construct a brooder
that will answer the purpose. The chief part
of the brooder is the source of heat. Usually
these heaters can be bought for a few dollars,
and placed in a good box supplied with a little
litter on the bottom.</p>

<p>A common arrangement with brooder equipments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
is to have two compartments, one where
a hover is placed, and the rest of the brooder
constituting a run for the chicks. The two
compartments are usually partitioned off from
each other, allowing just enough room at the
bottom of the partition to allow the chicks to
pass from one compartment to the other. In
the hover compartment is placed the heater,
and a metal canopy, so that the heat will be
held down close to the floor, where the chicks
are located. At first, the chicks should be confined
to this hover entirely, because they are
liable to get lost if they wander away from the
hover, and consequently die from chilling. The
temperature of the hover compartment during
the first week should be about 96 degrees F.,
and each succeeding week it should be lowered
by at least two degrees. This can be done by
controlling the lamp, or what ever heater is
used, or by gradually raising or lowering the
canopy over the chicks. This method gradually
toughens the chicks up, so that they can soon
be let out doors. After the first week or so,
they should be encouraged to get out into the
other compartment for exercise, as this will
aid in making them hardy. After the first few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
weeks of the life of the chicks are past, they
will need less care and attention. These first
few weeks are the critical weeks of the bird’s
life. After the chicks get accustomed to the
temperature out in the run of the brooder, it
is advisable to cut a small hole at the run end
of the brooder box, so that on pleasant days
they can run outside on the ground around the
brooder. In this case, however, they must not
be allowed to run very far at first, and only
for a short while until they gradually become
accustomed to the practice.</p>

<p>Another important consideration in raising
the young chick to maturity is the matter of
food. Probably no other thing is responsible
for such a high mortality in young chicks, as
is improper feeding. We have learned in a
previous chapter that it is exceedingly dangerous
to feed the chick anything in the line of
food for the first two days of its life. Many
people are afraid the chicks will die if not fed
immediately after hatching, and hasten to feed
the chick all that it will eat. Unless the chick
is endowed with a wonderful digestive system,
it will succumb to this over-feeding through
digestive disorders. It is permissible to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a little grit before the chick at this time, because
the chick has no teeth, and never will
have, so they eat the grit, and this grit passes
down to the gizzard, which grinds the food in
place of grinding with the teeth, as with other
animals. Fresh water is also good for the chick
during this period, as the water quenches their
thirst, and makes them livelier. Towards the
end of the second day, it is well to feed the
chick a little sour skim milk, or buttermilk.
Sour milk is superior to the sweet milk for two
reasons. First, the sour skim milk has bacteria
that aid in digestion, and secondly, it will be
found that it will be hard to keep the milk
sweet all the time, and by feeding sweet milk
part of the time, and then letting it become
sour, digestive troubles are liable to develop.
Hence, by having it sour all the time, no danger
from this source will be experienced.</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to consider what kind of
grain we shall feed the chick. On the third
day we can start to feed a little grain. What
is known as pinhead oatmeal is very good to
start the young chick out on. Some feed hard
boiled eggs and dried bread for the first feeding
with good results. It is important to note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
that only enough of this first solid food should
be fed that they can clean up in a short time.
Keep them hungry, and remember that it is
much safer to under feed than to over feed.</p>

<p>For the next week, or so, a scratch ration,
composed of cracked corn, pinhead oatmeal,
cracked wheat, together with a little grit, and
finely ground oyster shells can be fed. This
can be fed in the litter, so that the chicks have
to exercise to get it. In fact, that is just what
we mean by a scratching ration; one composed
of whole or cracked grains, mixed in with the
litter, so that the chicks will have to scratch
for their feed, and thereby obtain the exercise
necessary to their health. If a little green
feed of any kind can be added, so much the
better. Green grass is excellent to throw into
the chicks.</p>

<p>After two weeks or more of this kind of feed,
it is well to supplement this ration with a dry
mash. A dry mash is a feed composed of
ground feeds, that require no work on the part
of the bird to grind. Feeds like wheat bran,
ground oats, corn meal, etc., are good examples
of such feeds. Wheat bran is especially well
liked by these young birds, and it is recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
that they be allowed to have this as a
large part of their dry mash. This feed should
not be fed in the litter, as the cracked grains,
but placed in some such container as a pan, or
better still, in a regular feed hopper. It can
readily be seen that if this finely ground grain
was scattered in the litter, it would be largely
lost and wasted. Also, if put in a pan, the pan
must be low enough to be accessible to the
birds, and covered over in such a manner that
the chicks will not get in and walk around
in it. A homemade hopper can be easily built,
so that the chicks can just get their heads in,
and no more. Do not forget that the sour skim
milk or buttermilk must be fed all this time.
In fact, this part of the feed should be fed
right through the bird’s life, as it supplies the
animal protein, which is so necessary to the
proper development of the bird’s growth.</p>

<p>Now, then, just a few more words in closing
this chapter on brooding. We should aim to
toughen the birds up as quickly as possible,
so that when they are about two months old,
no artificial heat will be necessary, and if the
birds are of a late hatch, this can be accomplished
much sooner. Encourage them to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
out of doors as quickly as possible, and to get
green feed.</p>

<p>A very serious cause of death among young
chickens is from disease. White diarrhoea is
probably one of the most common of these
diseases, and unfortunately, one of the most
fatal. If the droppings are of a white, watery
nature, with an offensive odor, you may well
believe that this disease is present, and the
thing to do is to get the birds thus affected
out of the way at once, and disinfect with some
good disinfectant. However, if the precautions
are taken that are set forth in this booklet, no
danger of this dreaded disease can be anticipated.</p>

<p>Now that we have got the chicks along
through the brooding period, let us next consider
just how we shall raise these chicks to
maturity, so as to get them ready to lay eggs,
or to make a good meat carcass.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="fs70">REARING CHICKS TO MATURITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the chief things to remember in raising
young chicks to maturity is that we must
keep them growing at all times. A check in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
their growth will retard their growth severely,
and this must be avoided by the one that wants
his chicks to get into winter laying condition
before the cold weather comes. We will now
consider a few important factors that are necessary
to bring our chicks along to rapid growth.</p>

<p>Of course, where free, unrestricted range is
possible, the chicks will progress faster than
when cooped up in a small yard. If no free
range is possible, it will be found advantageous
to at least let the chicks run about the yard of
the lot. In this manner, they can pick up considerable
food in the shape of worms, insects,
etc., that will furnish valuable growing food for
them. Let me repeat again the necessity of
having milk in some form as a constituent of
the chicks’ food. Any food that comes from an
animal, whether it be milk or a part of the
animal itself, is highly essential to the growth
of the chick. Such foods contain an element
known as vitamines, which scientists have recently
discovered contribute greatly to the
growth and upkeep of a growing animal. Vitamines
are also found to some extent in green
feeds, such as carrots, cabbages, mangoes, etc.
Even well cured alfalfa hay contains this important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
element. It is quite obvious, therefore,
that if the chicks are out roaming around the
yard or range, they not only secure the exercise
that is necessary for their proper development,
but they also pick up insects, as has
been mentioned, and considerable green feed,
such as grass, weeds, and various other odds
and ends.</p>

<p>If a fair sized lot or range is to be had, then
it will be found a great aid to make a little
house for the chicks to live in during the
nights on the range, although care must be exercised
that they be protected from enemies,
such as rats, crows, skunks, weasels, owls, etc.
Such a house need not be expensive at all if
it be made out of an old packing box that will
protect the chicks from rain and enemies.</p>

<p>Another quite essential feature for the promotion
of the maximum growth of the chicks
during the warm summer months is the provision
for shade. If there are some trees about
the yard or range, this will answer the purpose
satisfactorily, but if there are no trees
where the chicks roam, then some artificial
shade is advised. Some people plant corn for
this purpose, allowing the chicks to range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
among the corn plants when the corn has grown
sufficiently high. The chicks will not harm
the corn, so two ends can be accomplished by
this means. Others provide this shade by
gathering old brush together and making an
artificial shade in this manner. During the hot
days of summer, the chicks will suffer from the
heat to a marked degree if exposed to the hot
rays of the sun. An ideal method used on many
farms is to place the chicks in the orchard,
where there is an orchard, and let the chicks
roam in the shade of the orchard trees.</p>

<p>Where birds are necessarily confined to a
small yard, one method that has been worked
out satisfactorily, is to fence the yard off into
two or more divisions, and to plow up the land.
Then various crops can be sown at different
intervals, so that when one range, or division,
is consumed by the chicks, they can be turned
into another division where the forage crop is
up and ready to be consumed. As soon as the
chicks are turned out of the first lot, this lot
can be immediately plowed up again, and some
more seeds planted, so that this range will be
ready for the chicks when the second lot furnishes
no more nourishment for them. It might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
be added here that many town flocks of full
grown birds are maintained, by this very system,
and it has worked out very nicely. Such
grains as buckwheat, rye, oats, peas, and soy
beans are all excellent crops to sow in this
manner, using oats and peas for the first crop,
because they mature quicker than the other
crops mentioned.</p>

<p>If the chicks have access to a fair amount
of range they will not need a great deal of
grain as a ration. However, it is always advisable
to feed some grains to keep the birds
continually growing as fast as possible. It
has been proved conclusively that the first
gains made by the growing chicks are the
cheapest, in regard to the cost of feed, so let
us keep this in mind during the time when
we have them on range. To accomplish this
end, it is well to have a dry mash of the kind
of grains that are fairly rich in the substance
called protein always available in the hopper.
The reason for this need of protein feed is
simply that the growing bird uses this element
largely in the growth of its body. Protein goes
to make up the bony framework of the body,
and the muscles, tendons, etc. Therefore, feeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
containing protein, or a fair amount of it at
least, should be ground up, and kept before the
birds. Oats, bran, or middlings, wheat and
barley, are all fairly rich in protein, and some
of these feeds, in a finely ground condition,
should be included. It is also well to add some
corn meal, although this feed is not high in
protein, it supplies a great amount of energy
for the bird to move around with. As soon as
the birds are old enough commence to feed
cracked grains. As has been said in a previous
chapter, the bird has no teeth, so must
rely upon grit to grind this feed in the gizzard.</p>

<p>Therefore, unless the birds have a wide
range, this grit must be artificially supplied.
Then the birds can help themselves to their
needs, and suffer no digestive troubles. Fresh
water must be before the birds at all times,
and if no natural source is available, such as
a running stream or brook, then fresh water
must be placed in some sanitary container out
in the yard or range.</p>

<p>From four to six months from the time the
chick is hatched, it should be ready to start laying
eggs. The chick first has to get its growth
and maturity, and then there is an apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
resting period for a few weeks, to allow the
organs of the bird to get ready for egg production.
We will next consider how we shall feed
these birds, granting that we now have them
ready to produce the eggs.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="fs70">FEEDING FOR EGG PRODUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As has been said in an earlier chapter, to
get the maximum egg production, three things
are essential. They are: good foundation stock,
proper housing, and proper feeding. We may
have the best chicken house in the world, and
the highest priced stock obtainable, but if we
do not feed our birds the right kind of food,
all our other efforts are in vain. Let us consider
first a few facts concerning the composition
of the egg, and then we will be able to
understand more intelligently why we should
feed the laying bird these certain feeds.</p>

<p>About 14 per cent of the composition of the
egg is protein, 10 per cent fat, and the remainder,
except the shell, is water. Now it
must be remembered that the ordinary protein
supply of most food materials is relatively low.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Corn contains about 7 per cent digestible protein,
oats and barley about 9 per cent, and bran
about 12 per cent. The roughages are considerably
lower, while green feeds carry about
one or two per cent protein. From this we can
get an idea about the necessity of watching the
feeding to the extent that this valuable constituent
is sufficiently supplied. Furthermore,
the hen that is producing these eggs needs a
fair amount of this protein for further growth
and body upkeep. Another point worth remembering
is the fact that the bird, or any other
animal, through natural instinct, always sees
to it that the first requirement, that of bodily
growth and upkeep are maintained first with
the food they are given, so that to get the most
from the birds, let us not hold them down to
just a maintenance ration, but give them
enough in addition so that they can not only
maintain their body requirements properly, but
also have enough food material to yield a
product.</p>

<p>The ration for the laying hen should consist
of the two forms of grain; first, the whole or
cracked grains that comprise the scratch ration,
and which should always be thrown in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
litter, so that they will have to exercise to get
it, and second, the dry mash, or a mixture of
various grains that are ground up and fed in
hoppers. As has been stated before, this grinding
of the feed is simply to make it easily digestible.
Furthermore, such finely ground
grains usually contain a higher percentage of
protein than the other grains. By this is meant
that feeds like bran, oilmeal, etc., are quite a
bit higher in protein than are grains like corn,
wheat, barley, etc.</p>

<p>The next important feed requirement for the
laying hen should be a mineral feed of some
kind. With many farm and city flocks this important
consideration is entirely ignored. Many
times the reason for poor egg production rests
solely in the lack of proper mineral foods.
When it is considered that about 12 percent
of the entire egg is composed of shell material,
it can readily be seen that the feeding of this
material is important, and worthy of attention.
We can give the laying bird all the rich feeds
that we can buy, but if we withhold from her
the material that goes to form the shell, then
the bird will be unable to lay her eggs because
she has no shell to cover the egg. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
different sources of mineral food, but all authorities
are agreed that oyster shells form the
most economical source of shell material. These
oyster shells can be bought at grocery stores,
or poultry supply houses. This material should
be placed in a box or, better still, a hopper,
where it will be accessible to the birds at all
times. Clam shells, lime rock grit, and dry
bone in small sizes are other sources of mineral
matter, and possibly even better results can
be obtained by adding a small quantity of these
other feeds to the oyster shells, but plan to
have oyster shells as the basis of the mineral
supply. Charcoal is sometimes fed to chickens
with good results. Some birds eat this, while
others will not. It is claimed that charcoal
aids in regulating the digestive system of the
fowl. One can try this out to satisfy his own
ideas in this regard.</p>

<p>Animal feed is the next class of feeds that
we will consider in the feeding of our laying
flock. It is the testimony of poultrymen that
when they hang up a fresh piece of meat in
the poultry house, such as a part of a calf, an
old horse, rabbit, or any other such carcass, the
birds always respond with a much higher yield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
in egg production. This simply reinforces the
statement made in a previous chapter, that
animal protein of some kind is needed by the
birds if they are to do their best. If meat is
supplied, care must be exercised that it does
not spoil before it is consumed. It is better
to put in small pieces at a time, so that the
birds will eat it up quickly. If this meat can
be run through a grinder of some kind, it will
be eaten much more readily than if it has to
be torn to pieces by the birds. Milk of some
kind is also an animal protein, as has been repeated
here several times. Meat meal or tankage
contains a high percentage of protein, and
as this is an animal product, it is an economical
feed.</p>

<p>Water is our last class of feeds for the laying
hen. This can be supplied in two ways.
The first way is from the water direct, placed
in some kind of a pan that is covered so that
the birds can not soil the water, by perching
on the edge of the pan, etc. Fresh water should
be before the birds at all times, as we have
just learned a few pages back that about 65
per cent of the egg is composed of water. Besides
this, the birds need water for their body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
requirements. In the winter when the birds
spend practically all of their time in the poultry
house, and can not have the opportunity of
picking up grass, and other green feeds, we
can supply water to them in the form of some
kind of green feeds, such as sprouted oats,
cabbages, mangoes, or any other vegetables to
be had. All these feeds are to be recommended
highly, as they not only are composed largely
of water, but add bulk to the ration, and aid
in keeping the bird laxative. Sprouted oats can
be raised in shallow pans, and given to the
birds in small quantities at a time. It is usually
advisable to have several pans of sprouting
oats say, for instance, one for every day in the
week, so that a fresh supply can be given to
the birds every morning. Nearly every supply
house has patent oat sprouters to sell at reasonable
prices. Cabbages and mangoes are also
fed extensively to the laying birds during the
winter months, but provision must be made
before hand to raise them in the summer, and
to properly store them in the fall, so that they
will be fresh when taken out of storage for feeding.
One very good way to do this is to pile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
them together in a basement and cover them
with sand.</p>

<p>Let us next consider a few practical grain
rations, that have been tried out by successful
poultry men. These rations are always
classified as scratch rations and dry mash rations.
One very good ration is as follows:
Scratch Feed, 3 parts cracked corn, 1 part
wheat, 1 part oats, 1 part barley. Dry mash,
1½ part bran, 1½ part middlings, 1 part corn
meal, 1 part meat scraps or tankage. Another
very good practical ration is composed as follows:
Scratch feed, 3 parts corn, 1 part oats,
and 1 part barley. Dry mash, one part each of
bran, middlings, ground corn, ground oats and
meat scraps. These feeds should always be
measured by weight, and not by bulk.</p>

<p>Now, then, just a few words in regard to
the feeding of these grains. Always send the
birds to roost with full crops. This is especially
important during cold weather. It is
much better if they be allowed to fill up on
scratch grain rather than dry mash. The
scratch ration is more bulky than the mash
feed, and helps in keeping the bird warm. In
fact, many successful poultry men close the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
hopper of their dry mash ration during the
afternoon, and thus make the birds take the
scratch feed in the litter, thereby encouraging
the birds to obtain exercise, also.</p>

<p>We will close this chapter with a brief discussion
on a recent development in the system
of feeding birds. This is in regard to the introduction
of artificial light. This practice has
successfully passed beyond the “fad” stage and
is now being used by successful poultry men
all over the country. By supplying this extra
light, the working day is thereby lengthened to
the extent that the light is prolonged, and consequently,
gives the bird a day similar to a
summer day in length. The birds, by having
this extra period of light, work just that much
longer, and as a result, they are able to make
more eggs. Everywhere this system has been
given a trial, it has been found a paying proposition.
One very common method in supplying
this light is by connecting the alarm clock to
the electric lighting system and setting the
alarm at a period around four or five o’clock in
the morning. This throws on the light in the
chicken house, and then when the owner arises
in the morning, he can go out and turn out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
lights if it is light enough to do so by that
time.</p>

<p>Thus we have considered the main points in
feeding for egg production. While we have
some of these important feeding principles still
fresh in our mind, let us in the next chapter
consider feeding birds for their flesh, because
one very important part of the poultry business
lies in the feeding of birds for meat. In the
ordinary flock of birds, there are always some
that we want to dispose of, such as the male
birds and the culls of the females. If we know
how to fatten these, we will be that much
better off financially.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="fs70">FEEDING FOR MEAT PRODUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The primary object in feeding birds for the
market is to get them well covered with flesh,
so that they will be plump all over. It is the
difference in the weight of the bony skeleton
and the weight of the well filled out carcass
that determines the amount of edible meat on
the bird. Hence our object in this process is
to put on as much surplus flesh as we can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Usually there are three classes of birds that
are put on the market for meat purposes. They
are roasters, broilers, and old hens. Roasting
chickens are very common on the market, and
the object is large size with a tender carcass.
These can be either pullets or cockerels, or
capons. They are often put on the market during
the late fall or early winter, and bring the
highest prices at that time.</p>

<p>Broilers are birds about three or four months
old, forced along to a rapid growth, but still
possessing tender flesh. This offers an excellent
way of disposing of the male birds, since
usually the sex of the young birds can be distinguished
at about two months of age.</p>

<p>Old hens constitute the third division of the
meat classes placed upon the market, and are
generally composed of those birds that are
through laying, or the ones that have been
found to be unprofitable. Their meat is usually
much tougher than the first two mentioned
classes, and consequently used in city restaurants
for meat pies, etc.</p>

<p>In fattening birds for the market, a somewhat
different procedure is followed than in
feeding for egg production. We found that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
feeding for egg production we encouraged the
birds in every way possible to take all the exercise
that they could get. We do just the
opposite in putting flesh on the birds. We restrict
their exercise as much as possible, and
pen them up in small quarters so that their
feed largely goes to nothing but putting flesh
on their bodies. It can easily be seen that
when birds are roaming around, exercising
more or less all day long, that there is little
chance for them to get very fat.</p>

<p>Now as to the nature of the feed for fattening
these birds. We will still need some protein
feeds, but not as much as in the case of
feeding for eggs. However, we will need feeds
which are quite rich in carbohydrates and fat.
These are easily obtained and are relatively
cheap. Corn is an excellent ration for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Since the birds are confined to small pens,
and exercise restricted, it becomes evident that
digestion becomes an important factor here.
Therefore, it is advisable to have plenty of
grit before the birds at all times, so that their
food will be properly ground.</p>

<p>We must not get the idea, just because we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
are feeding for flesh, that the birds should be
stuffed to their limit with feed. To do so,
would be to have a lot of the birds off feed,
and consequently we would be worse off than
not to feed them enough. It is best to plan to
feed them about three times a day, and to
feed them all that they will cleanup in a
certain length of time, as from twenty minutes
to half an hour. Some are successful in feeding
only twice a day, instead of three times a
day.</p>

<p>Corn is usually the basis of fattening rations
and should always have a prominent place in
the ration. Here again, milk in some form is
excellent to supply some of the protein that
is needed. Corn must be supplemented by
other grains, such as oats, barley or middlings,
provided they are in a finely ground condition.
Some feeders follow the plan of feeding part
of these grains in the form of a wet mash,
using the skim milk to moisten the mash,
but when this is done, care must be exercised
in seeing that the mash is cleaned up at every
feeding, otherwise the trough will become
mouldy, with bad results to the birds.</p>

<p>There has come into use within recent years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
a method of fattening birds by what is known
as crate fattening. This is practiced considerably
by some of the big packing companies.
The birds are bought up from the surrounding
territory and brought into the central fattening
station. They are then placed in small pens,
or batteries, as they are called, and fed a
ration composed largely of skim milk and corn
meal, with a few other feeds added, such as
red dog flour, bran, etc. This is mixed into
a thin, pasty feed, and fed the birds from a
trough running along in front of the pens.
They are fed this way for a period of two
weeks or more, and are then taken out, dressed,
and sold to the big city markets as milk fed
chickens, and always bring several cents a
pound more on the market than other poultry,
because of the tenderness of the flesh. In this
process, even greater care must be exercised
in watching the feeding of the birds, and only
feed that they will cleanup in about fifteen
or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Crate feeding has appealed to many town lot
poultry men, who have bought up culls of the
neighboring territory, put them in small crates
or pens, and fed them this milk feed for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
few weeks and then marketed them, securing
the top prices on the market.</p>

<p>We have now discussed the most important
items connected with the feeding of the birds
for various purposes. Let us now examine the
living quarters of the birds, and see if we can
improve the housing conditions in which the
birds live during the winter months.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="fs70">COMMON FAULTS OF POULTRY HOUSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If you were to take a trip through the surrounding
country, with the intention of inspecting
the living quarters of farm poultry,
in general, you would discover some of the most
wretched houses imaginable. All of our intelligent
feeding would be of little use if we
penned our chickens up in a coop with little
sunlight, poor ventilation, cold, damp floors,
drafty sides, and foul, damp air. It doesn’t
cost any more to build a poultry house with
correct principles involved, than it does to
build one that lacks these essential features.
The birds care very little about the appearance
of the house. They want fresh dry air, freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
from drafts, a warm floor, and plenty of
sunshine.</p>

<p>One of the most common faults with most
poultry houses is the matter of ventilation.
When poultry raising was first looked upon as
a promising business, many men erected houses
containing a large proportion of glass. It was
thought that the sunshine was the only necessary
feature for the birds under winter conditions,
and they made their chicken houses
veritable hot houses. But the results were not
as had been anticipated. It was found that
while the houses were fairly warm in the day
time, they cooled off considerable at night, and
poor results were obtained from this wide range
between the day temperature and the night
temperature. Then another step was taken by
these pioneers. They decided to heat their
houses artificially. But even this system did
not bring forth the big yield of eggs that had
been hoped for. In all this expensive procedure,
a very important element had been
overlooked, and that was the matter of fresh
air.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, there was devised
a poultry house that was a radical departure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
from this previous type of house. It was called
the open front house, and gave surprisingly
good results, where all previous types had
failed, as regards egg production. This house
was constructed briefly as follows: It was of
the shed roof type; that is, had just one slant
in the roof, the highest pitch being in front,
and the lowest pitch in the rear. It had plenty
of window light in the front side, about half
of the south side, or front, being devoted to
windows. The rest of the front was left open,
save for a thin muslin curtain to cover the
open space during bad weather. These curtains
were tacked to wooden frames, and swung
on hinges, so that they could be swung in to
cover the open space at will. The most remarkable
thing about the system was that the
hens began to lay eggs, when proper feeding
was obtained. Later, this led to the conclusion,
now generally accepted, that the birds can
stand considerable cold, providing it is not a
damp cold, and that the temperature of the
house is considerably more uniform between
night and day than was the case with the glass
house.</p>

<p>As a result many poultrymen who are making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
money with poultry use some such system
as the open front house with various changes.
They have found that fresh air is an absolute
requirement to get the best results. But this
matter brought out a few more interesting facts.
It was found that dampness was a big drawback
to egg production in cold weather. If the
damp foul air, breathed out by the chickens,
could not escape from the poultry building, the
chickens did not have the health and vigor that
they did in well ventilated houses. Consequently,
the curtain helped considerably in allowing
the fresh air to come in, and for the
foul air to go out. The damp air, being heavily
laden with moisture, settled to the bottom of
the house, where the birds scratch, and unless
the curtains extend fairly well down near the
bottom of the house, the damp air has not a
very good chance to escape, and consequently,
there will be more or less moisture even with
this type of house, if the damp air has no
chance to escape.</p>

<p>Another common fault with a great many
poultry buildings is that they are drafty. The
walls should all be air tight, except the south
wall, or front, as has been mentioned. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
there is a draft in the house the birds will
contract a cold, and will take a prolonged vacation
from their job of laying eggs. It is
not uncommon to find a crack in the wall,
just behind the perches of the house, and when
we consider that in such houses the birds stay
all night in a direct draft, it is little wonder
that they appear so unhealthy.</p>

<p>There are a few other common faults that
we will consider before bringing this chapter to
a close. It is often found that there are too
many birds cramped into a small house. It
is a good plan to allow at least four square
feet of floor space for each bird that you winter.
For instance, if we were planning on
having one hundred birds this winter, we could
have a house built twenty-five feet long, and
sixteen feet deep. Multiplying these two figures,
gives us four hundred square feet. Dividing
this product by four, gives us allowance
for one hundred birds. Then, lastly, the floor,
itself. Too often the floor is cold. If a cement
floor, we should cover it with about six
or eight inches of good, clean, dry litter. Even
if made of wood, a good substantial litter should
be maintained. The best litter is probably of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
straw, but peat moss is fast gaining favor at
present, where straw is not obtainable. With
these few objections to guard against, let us
next discuss just how we shall go about constructing
a poultry house that will overcome
the faults mentioned.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="fs70">HOUSING POULTRY FOR PROFIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In discussing plans for a modern poultry
house, let it be mentioned at the outset that
this does not necessarily mean that our modern
house will be expensive, any more than the one
that is built on old ideas. In fact, many of
the older houses were much more expensive
than the modern houses of today. As long as
the poultry building includes the necessary
principles for the birds’ well-being, and this can
be accomplished with little added expense,
that is all that is necessary.</p>

<p>In commenting upon the common faults of
most poultry houses in the previous chapter,
we found that they generally lack one, or all
of such items as ventilation, dryness, sunlight,
adequate floor space, protection from rats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
protection from extremes of temperature, and
simplicity of design. In arranging for a better
house for our birds, let us plan to keep these
factors in mind, so as to get the most from
our birds.</p>

<p>Whether we are to build a new poultry
house, or to remodel an old one, we can design
it so that all of these factors will be in evidence.
If we have an old poultry house, or if
we can buy cheaply an old poultry coop, that
has fairly good lumber in it, we can probably
do the remodeling somewhat cheaper than if
we have to buy all new lumber. If we do purchase
all new lumber, it is not advisable to get
cheap lumber, but buy the first grade, because
it is necessary that the walls of the house be
air tight, and this is seldom possible with cheap
lumber.</p>

<p>We will first consider briefly the possibilities
of remodeling an old poultry house. Probably
the first thing that we will do is to cut some
openings in the front of the house for windows
and curtains. From one-half to two-thirds
of the front should be devoted to window
lights. The remainder should be left for the
muslin curtains to allow for fresh air to enter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and for foul air to pass out. These should
not be cut up too high, but start at least a
foot below the roof, and have the window lights
extend at least half way down the front of the
house. The curtains should extend quite a bit
further down to the bottom of the house, to
allow the foul air sufficient opportunity to
escape.</p>

<p>We should next examine the other walls and
roof to make sure that they are not drafty,
nor leak water. Usually these walls can be
patched up with other boards, or heavy roofing
paper, so that no draft is possible. In northern
climates, where weather below zero is
common, best results will be obtained by having
two thicknesses of walls, to protect against
cold nights. Roofing paper is excellent to put
between the two walls, or even on the outside
to aid in this matter. If the roof leaks, it
might be advisable to re-shingle part of it,
and here again roofing paper helps in making
it weather tight.</p>

<p>We must next examine the floor. If a
wooden floor, then it is advisable to raise the
house up from the ground about six inches,
supporting it with posts. Some people follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the plan of placing old tin pans or plates upside
down at the top of these posts and then
setting the house on, thereby eliminating the
danger of rats, as the rats cannot climb over
the tin pans. If the house is to be a permanent
structure it will be found best to lay a
concrete floor, as this floor will last for all
time, and will not need repairing. Such a floor
is rat proof, but must be covered with a good
litter.</p>

<p>If a new house is to be constructed, then it
will be best to follow the principles laid down
for a remodeled house to the extent of the
open front, weather tight walls and roof, good
floor, and dry living conditions. Wood is the
most popular material that is used in building
chicken houses. Generally, 2 by 4s placed about
two feet apart are used for studding. Matched
lumber or rough lumber aided by battens or
roofing paper compose the walls, this making
them free from drafts. The matched lumber
is generally placed on the studding horizontally.
The lumber should be dry and free from knot
holes, and well nailed together.</p>

<p>For the roof, shingles can be used, or some
of the prepared roofing paper on the market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
now has given good results. For quite flat
roofs, two or three ply roofing paper is preferred
to the shingles.</p>

<p>We will now discuss the common types of
poultry houses. The most popular type and
the cheapest, is the shed roof house. This
house is usually about eight feet high in front,
slanting gradually to the rear to a height of
about five feet. It just has one slant, and, as
has been said, is cheaper to build than other
types of houses. It is also much easier to keep
warm in the winter, because of the low roof,
which means less space has to be heated by
the birds. Instead of curtain front houses in
such a type of poultry house, many poultry
men are using bafflers to let in the air. These
bafflers are similar to a blind used to shade
living houses in some parts of the country.
They are composed of slats less than an inch
apart, and placed in a slanting position, rather
than vertical or horizontal.</p>

<p>The gable roof house is another popular
type. This differs from the shed roof type
of house in that its roof comes to a peak,
with two pitches, such as most modern bungalow
dwelling houses have. This system leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
a larger space at the top of the house, and is
not as warm as the shed roof type. It also
costs more to build. However, it possesses the
advantage of allowing a straw loft to be placed
at the top of the house, which is an excellent
way to get rid of excess moisture, when it can
be expelled no other way. The straw has the
power to absorb the excess moisture during the
winter, but should be removed in the spring,
as it furnishes an excellent hiding place for
mites, an insect that we will discuss more
thoroughly in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The half monitor type is not so popular as
the two types already named, and costs considerably
more than either of the two previous
types discussed. This type of house has an
arrangement similar to two shed roof houses,
facing each other, the rear house being somewhat
higher than the front house. Of course,
such houses have their advantages, but for the
one who would start with moderation in the
poultry business, the shed roof, or the gable
roof type will be far more attractive. We have
discussed the types of houses in this chapter.
The fixtures, or chicken furniture, has so far
been omitted. Let us go inside of our modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
chicken house now, and see what is needed in
the line of equipment to complete our efficient
egg production.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="fs70">INTERIOR FIXTURES FOR THE LAYING HOUSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There are certain devices that save a great
deal of labor for the poultry man, and also
give the birds a more contented atmosphere.
We will start in with the floor. I want to
repeat here, briefly, what has already been
said in regard to the litter on the floor of the
house. Birds with cold feet cannot be healthy.
If the floor is covered with a six-inch litter of
straw, or shavings, the floor will be warm, and
they can be given a scratching ration that will
make them exercise for their food. By all
means do not fail to have a good litter of
some kind on the floor during the late fall
and winter months.</p>

<p>The birds are rather peculiar creatures, when
it comes to retiring for the night. They do not
seek a place to lay down, but they look for
something that will resemble a limb of a tree,
where they can perch during the night. Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
has therefore supplied something along this
line, by erecting round poles, made of wood,
so that the birds will have a convenient place
to rest for the night. A few precautions must
be guarded against here, however, as very few
poultry men have given their birds suitable
perches yet. The perches should be round,
about two inches in diameter, and erected on
the same level with each other. Too many
perches are arranged in a ladder formation,
having the rear perch the highest, and the
front perch the lowest. When the birds get
ready to go to roost, there is always an argument
as to which bird will have the rear roost,
as they all want the highest place to roost, or
perch. If the perches are all on the same
level, then there is no preference, and things
are more peaceful at roosting time. We should
plan on allowing about ten inches per bird for
perching room. Plan to have a distance
of about fourteen inches between each perch,
or pole. Arrange these perches at the rear
of the house, running parallel with the rear
wall.</p>

<p>All modern poultry men have what is known
as a dropping board under the perches, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the droppings will not fall in the scratching
litter and soil this part of the scratching area.
These dropping boards are usually placed about
six inches under the perches, and extend as
far forward as the perches do. This makes
the job of cleaning the poultry house quite a
simple operation. It is advisable to sprinkle
some sand over the dropping boards to absorb
the moisture and bad odor.</p>

<p>We have to give the birds a comfortable, well
secluded place to lay their eggs. This is sometimes
done by placing the nests, or the part
facing the front wall, covered over with a
board, that can be raised by means of a hinge,
when collecting the eggs. The hen can be
made to enter the nest from the rear, and if
conditions are so that the nest is darkened,
then the hen will prefer this place to any
other place in the house. Nests can also be
placed along the front wall, underneath the
windows, or on either side of the house. However,
up to the present time, below the dropping
boards seems to be the most popular place for
the nests with most poultry men.</p>

<p>Every poultry house should have a dust box.
This is a box partially filled with dust or fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
soil, and placed in the front part of the house,
so that it will be in the sunlight. The birds
appreciate such a device, and will use it generously,
as this aids them in fighting off insects
that prey upon them.</p>

<p>Suitable containers for food and water should
be provided, and kept clean. The drinking
fountains are of various designs, and one can
buy these very cheaply. They are usually jars
or cans inverted, so that the water will come
out in a small opening at the bottom, just large
enough for the bird to stick its head in. The
food containers, for the dry mash are generally
of the hopper kind, having a box-like container
with a trough at the bottom, so that the food
falls down into the small trough by gravity as
the birds consume it. Thus, in a good sized
hopper, a week’s ration of mash can be put in
the hopper without further attention.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="fs70">LICE AND MITES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While we have interior fixtures of the poultry
house fresh in mind let us turn our attention
briefly to the study of parasites that live on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
hen, and that are detrimental to her progress.
There are quite a few various insects that depend
upon the hen for their existence, but for
our purposes we can consider them in a general
class of lice and mites, as the treatment for
each class is practically the same.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the case of lice. These
insects live upon the body of the hen, eating
the flesh, and dead skin as it peels off. They
never leave the hen, and if conditions are favorable,
will lay their eggs on her body, thus multiplying
rapidly if precautions are not taken to
look after this matter. It is always well to
treat a setting hen for lice before she is placed
on the nest, and then once or twice after she
has started her job, because these lice will very
readily transfer from the mother hen to the
young chicks, as soon as hatched, and a great
many chicks die every year from these lice.
It is a splendid idea to grease all baby chicks,
especially those hatched by natural incubation,
with blue ointment, around the head parts, and
wings. The hens can also be greased in a
similar manner over the whole body.</p>

<p>Here is where the dust box that we discussed
briefly in the previous chapter comes in, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
birds, wallowing in the box of dust, smother
the lice, by shaking the dust into the pores of
the bird’s body. A rather recent method of
combating lice on birds is now fast gaining
favor. This is the Sodium Floride treatment.
This is best used only on a mild day, however,
as the birds are quite wet after their treatment
under this method. The treatment is
usually given as follows: Take an ordinary
wash tub, and fill nearly full with not too cold
water. For every gallon of water in the tub,
add one ounce of sodium floride, obtainable at
any drug store. Dip the hen in this solution,
tail first, being sure to have a firm grasp on
her so she will not splash the water over. Dip
her in this manner about three times, so that
the solution comes up in under the feathers.
This method has been found to be very effective.
In extreme cases, where the lice are very
bad, another similar treatment can be given
each bird about a month later. Other good
materials to apply to the bird’s body, besides
those already mentioned, are sweet oil, vaseline,
and lard.</p>

<p>Now we come to another pest that is a little
harder to get rid of than the body lice. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
mites, which are so bothersome to most poultry,
have the peculiar habit of staying on the birds
only during the night, creeping down at daylight
to some crack or crevice to hide until
darkness again forces the birds to go to roost.
These mites are even more destructive in their
work than are the body lice. They are generally
found in any crack or crevice about the
perches. Here they can obscure themselves,
and be very close to their prey when ready to
begin their work at night. While the lice are
eating insects, the mites are sucking insects,
and suck the blood of the birds during the
night. When the mite is hungry, he is of a
yellowish color. When filled up, however, with
a good meal of blood, he is red. The mite is
very small, and is similar in construction to
a spider.</p>

<p>If a flock of chickens are believed to be
suffering from mites, and there are very few,
by the way, that are not troubled with these
pests, then it would be advisable first, to whitewash
the poultry house thoroughly, not only
the roosting quarters, but the walls and other
fixtures inside the house. Kerosene is quite
frequently used to spray the nests with, but has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
not the lasting power that some of the coal tar
products possess. Recently, wood preservatives
have been used for the purposes of ridding the
poultry house of mites, and very good results
have been obtained from this method.</p>

<span class="fs70">POULTRY DISEASES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is not to be supposed that poultry, living
under the artificial conditions that man has
ordained for them, can be entirely free from
diseases. In fact, very few poultry men can
say that they have not had some kind of disease
affect their flock. Most diseases are contagious,
so it is important to be on the watch for any
symptoms of anything out of the ordinary.
Sanitation plays a very important part in keeping
the flock free from diseases, and clean
methods should always prevail. Do not allow
the house to become filthy and foul smelling.
It is always a good precaution to disinfect the
poultry premises at least once a year with a
good whitewash or some strong disinfectant.
This is about the same as taking out a life
insurance policy for the flock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Dampness is probably about the most common
cause for diseases. Disease germs always
multiply more rapidly in damp, dark quarters.
Therefore the advice given in an early chapter
about keeping the poultry house light and well
ventilated, will bear repetition. If one is accustomed
to watching his birds as to their
physical condition, he will be able to notice
the symptoms of any on-coming disease in time
to isolate the bird thus affected, before the
disease has a chance to spread, if it is a contagious
disease. By watching a bird thus
isolated, and also looking very carefully for any
further symptoms in the flock, one can do considerable
in checking the disease. The old
adage, “An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure,” certainly is true in this case.</p>

<p>Indigestion is a very common ailment with
poultry, especially with those birds that are fed
heavy for egg production. Usually a little
laxative material placed in the drinking water,
and making more of their ration a scratching
ration, in order to induce exercise, is probably
as simple and effective a treatment as can be
given.</p>

<p>Roup, chicken pox, and canker are also very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
common poultry diseases. These three diseases
are all supposed to be due to a small organism
which multiply very rapidly, and acts mostly
on the skin of the bird. These diseases are not
similar in appearance, however, despite the fact
that their source is the same.</p>

<p>Roup attacks the mucous membrane lining
of the nose, and eye. These parts become red
and inflamed, and infected with a pus formation.
This disease is spread largely through
the drinking water, and is prevalent in the
spring when it is damp. Keep the birds healthy
and vigorous, provide proper ventilation, and
have things as dry as possible, and little should
be feared from this source.</p>

<p>Chicken pox makes its appearance on the
comb and wattles, and also on the face of the
bird, by small pockets on these parts. The
remedy is the same in this case as has been
stated for roup, except that if only a few birds
have contracted the disease, each bird can be
taken in hand and given individual treatment,
by removing the crust over the sores, and applying
a good disinfectant.</p>

<p>Canker manifests itself by pale yellow spots
on the inside of the mouth. This is best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
treated, as soon as discovered, by scraping off
this light yellow material, and applying a good
disinfectant.</p>

<p>All of these last three named diseases are
caused by the same conditions, and by avoiding
these conditions very little trouble will be
experienced in this malady. Birds that have
had any of the above mentioned diseases should
never be used for breeding purposes, as their
offspring will have a predisposition to the same
ailment.</p>

<p>Sometimes the perches are placed too high
in the chicken house, and the birds have to
jump too far to reach the floor. When this
happens, a hard lump often forms on the sole of
the foot. This is sometimes called bumble foot,
and is usually evident in the chicken’s walk.
Nothing but cutting out the hard part, and
washing the sore with a good disinfectant can
remedy this condition.</p>

<p>While frosted combs could not be called a
contagious disease, we will discuss this matter
briefly, before closing this chapter. In severe
weather, when the temperature is below zero,
and there is considerable dampness in the
poultry house, frozen combs are quite frequent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
This is especially true of the lighter birds,
which possess larger head parts than do the
heavier breeds. When a bird has its comb or
wattles frozen, it will stop laying for a considerable
period of time, usually a month at
least. If birds are found on a cold winter
morning with frozen combs, they should be
treated with snow or cold water, to take out
the frost, and then treated daily with vaseline
until cured. It is well to provide a pole up
near the roof of the poultry house, upon which
a curtain, made of burlap or some old cloth,
is arranged so that on cold winter nights this
curtain can be lowered directly in front of the
front perch. This will tend to protect the
birds from the excessive cold, by conserving the
heat given off by their bodies during the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<span class="fs70">CULL THE FLOCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the poultry industry was being established
upon a business foundation, many of the
leading breeders devised the idea of measuring
the egg capacity of their birds by actually
counting the eggs laid by their best birds. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
practice is still followed by many poultry
breeders, but is a job that consumes considerable
time, and it can be seen that only those
who are constantly with the flock could be able
to do this. But within the last few years, there
has been developed a system whereby one can
tell by the external appearance of the bird just
about what her ability as an egg producer will
be in one year. A Mr. Hogan was the first
man to notice these characteristics and his
method has been so far perfected that most
poultry keepers are quite familiar with it, and
thereby saved the bother of trap-nesting.</p>

<p>This culling process, as it is called, is best
accomplished during the months of August and
September. By picking up each female in the
flock at this time, except of course the spring
pullets, one can find out which birds are still
laying, and which ones have already quit. It
has been in the past too much the custom of
farmers to go out into their poultry flock in
the fall of the year, and pick out the birds
that had not yet started to moult, and whose
appearance was ragged and rather uncomely.
These birds would be picked out by the farmer,
or in many cases his wife, and sent to market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
as meat birds, and they would keep the birds
who had already moulted, and whose feathers
were in splendid color at that time. However,
in the light of recent facts brought out by this
culling process, we now know that these rather
ragged, unsightly birds were our best layers,
and should have been kept because they had
been working continuously, not taking the
time off to quit laying and look pretty, as had
their more lazy companions. There are still
a great number of people that cling to the old
method, but the light is dawning, and it will
probably be but a short while before practically
everyone interested in poultry will know of
this culling method, and who can in a brief
examination of a bird tell quite readily whether
she should be kept or sold.</p>

<p>We will now discuss the various methods by
which a bird can be judged as to her egg
laying ability. No one sign can be relied upon,
but the different signs taken together should
form the final judgment. One can usually
tell something about the bird by her general
habits. The good layer is a busy hen. She is
happy, singing, and not as afraid of the attendant
as is the loafer. As this hen usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
eats more than the non-layer, she is usually
found busily scratching in the litter for the
food material with which she makes her eggs.
The good layer is always the first off the
roost in the morning, and the last one to go
to roost at night. Watch out for the timid,
crafty hen that stays on the outskirts of the
flock. She is lazy, inactive, and the quicker
she is sent to the butcher, the better. Another
very good aid in forming judgment as
to the ability of the birds, is to go around
the roosts at night, after the birds have all
gone to roost. Feel of their crops. The good
layer that has been working hard to get together
food material for her eggs will have
a full crop, while her lazy companions, that
are not so interested in producing eggs, will
have a fairly empty crop at this time. Little
items such as I have mentioned here will tell
considerable about the ability of the birds. It
is a fact that there are any number of birds
in America that lay only a few dozen eggs per
year, but are kept the year round, because
the owner has had no way of knowing the
producers from the non-producers.</p>

<p>As has been already brought out, the heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
layers molt late. Often they continue laying
up until October and November. If you have
hens nearly naked of feathers in October or
November, just rest assured that these are
your most profitable birds, and that they did
not quit laying to put on a pretty coat of
feathers in the middle of the summer. You
should mark these birds in some manner, so
that you can use them as breeders for the
coming winter, because, if they are mated
with a cockerel, that is the son of a good
layer, your strain will be greatly improved,
because these birds will transmit their laying
ability to their offspring.</p>

<p>A good laying hen will have a long, broad,
and deep, rectangular body, with top and bottom
lines parallel. This large sized body is
essential to the hen, so that she will have
sufficient room to digest enough food to make
her eggs. A broad back is also necessary for
proper room for the reproductive organs that
make the egg. The head of the good layer
is always of a healthy appearance. The good
layer has a short stubby beak, or bill, and
gracefully curved, as compared to the long
shapeless bill of the loafer. The eyes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
prominent, and stick out similar to a shoe
button, rather than sunken in. The combs
and wattles are red, and not pale, as in the
non-layer.</p>

<p>The good layer will not have the bright colored
yellow, after she has been laying for a
short while, that the loafer will have. This
is because she uses this yellow pigment in
making the yolk of her eggs, so that as her
laying period proceeds, she becomes more and
more faded in her bill, eye lids, ear lobes, and
shanks. Consequently, if some of your birds
have a faded appearance, don’t condemn them,
they are the hardest workers in your flock.
Furthermore, the hen with worn toe-nails is
one that should be kept, because this shows
us quite clearly that she uses them considerably
in scratching for her feed.</p>

<p>Now let us examine the anatomy of the hen
a little more closely so that we can get some
more evidence for or against the hen in question.
One of the most common ways, nowadays,
in picking out the laying hen is to examine
what is known as the pelvic bones.
These are found on either side of the vent,
towards the rear of the body. They are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
called the lay bones by most poultry
men. They both mean the same. Now these
bones tell a vivid story. These bones are
usually measured by the fingers, or as to how
many fingers can be inserted between the two
bones. A poor layer will have a thick, grizzly
covering of meat over the lay, or pelvic
bones, and just about the width of one finger
can be inserted between them. This shows
us quickly that she is not a layer. Then,
lets compare this poor layer to the good layer.
Here we find something different. There is
just a slight covering over the pelvic bones.
The meat is thin and spare. If we feel of
the bones, we find them quite thin and pliable.
We next try to insert as many fingers between
the two bones as possible. We will find
that we can insert at least two fingers, and
probably three, if our fingers are not too wide.
The heavier the hen is laying, the wider the
distance between the bones.</p>

<p>Now, while we have the bird, let us look a
little further into this bird’s conformation. The
keel bone, or rear end of the breast bone, can
be used as one unit, and the lay bones as
the other unit of measure. See how many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
fingers you can get between the lay bones and
the keel bone. Even for a small breed you
should easily get in the width of three fingers,
and for a larger breed you should get in
the width of four fingers. This measures the
hen’s capacity for feed.</p>

<p>This distance between the lay bones and
the keel bone is called the abdomen. We can
tell considerable about the hen by the texture
of the abdomen skin. If the skin is tough,
and meaty, we can say right away that she
is not a good hen, but if the skin is tender,
pliable, and soft, then we can feel assured
that she must be kept in the flock.</p>

<p>These are the principal features in selecting
the laying hen. If one can get these principles
in mind, and go out into his flock and
separate the hens into two flocks, and keep
these two flocks apart for a while, he would
discover some interesting things. For instance,
cull out the poor hens and put them in
one pen. Possibly you will have the largest
pen, when you have finished, composed of the
poor layers. Keep the good hens in another
pen separated from the poor ones. Keep feeding
the same feeds as you had been doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
before you separated the flock into two pens.
Now, for a few weeks, compare the daily egg
record of the two flocks. You will find that
there is about as much difference as between
night and day. Now, to bring the lesson home
a little more forceful, just figure out what
it costs you per day to keep these star boarders,
and see if you think culling is a paying
proposition. Most every agricultural college
has a bulletin printed on culling giving essentially
the same information as I have given,
but they usually have quite a few illustrations
that will make the procedure a little more
clearer than I have done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="fs70">PRESERVING EGGS FOR WINTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was deemed advisable to add a few words
in this little booklet in regard to collecting eggs
when they are cheap, and storing them away
for the part of the year when eggs are high
priced. During the months of March, April,
May, and June eggs are the cheapest on the
market, due to the fact that the birds are all
laying during these few months, and consequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the supply far exceeds the average
demand. If we pay fifteen cents for a dozen
of eggs in April, or May, and then in December
we pay sixty cents or more for the same
product, then it can easily be seen that it is a
paying proposition to store some of these
cheap spring eggs for winter use. We will now
take up the method of storing these spring eggs
for our December breakfast.</p>

<p>To make this process about 100 per cent
efficient, it is best to candle the eggs first,
before storing them away. This process of
candling has been explained in a previous chapter.
If the air cell, at the blunt end of the
egg is small, then we may be sure that the egg
is of recent origin. If the contents look clear,
and the yolk is not loose, inside the shell, then
we need have no fears as to the edibility of the
egg. One very good way, for one not accustomed
to candling, is to examine a few in
front of the light, and then break a few in a
dish, so as to get the proper relation fixed in
mind. If we can secure eggs that are infertile,
we will not have to throw out hardly any
eggs in this process.</p>

<p>In preparing to preserve our eggs for winter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
there are several methods used by people who
follow this practice. Some just pack the eggs
in sawdust in a box or barrel, but this method
is not always reliable. There are two standard
ways of preserving these eggs. One is in using
waterglass, and the other is the use of lime
water solution. Both methods are reliable, but
the first named method seems to be the more
popular of the two. In either case, earthen
crocks or wooden pails are the best containers.
Neither of these solutions affects them. A
three gallon container is large enough to preserve
ten dozen eggs. For this sized container,
about six quarts of the solution will be necessary.</p>

<p>We will discuss the waterglass method first.
Procure the amount of waterglass that you will
need for this year at a drug store. Use this
at the rate of one pint of waterglass to nine
pints of water. Before mixing the two liquids,
boil the water, and let it cool. Then mix the
two liquids, in the proportion stated, and place
in container. Then add the eggs, (about ten
dozen to this mixture), and store in a cool
place. Be sure that there is about two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
inches of the solution above the eggs, and add
a little water occasionally to replace the water
lost by evaporation.</p>

<p>The lime solution is mixed a little differently.
Slack about two pounds of quick lime in a
small quantity of hot water. After this has
slacked, add it to about two gallons of water,
and then add one pound of salt. Stir this in
a thorough manner, and then allow the mixture
to settle. There will then be found a sediment
in the bottom of the solution. Pour off the
clear liquid, and use this as the preservative
material. Then keep the same as directions
given for the waterglass preparation. In this
manner, one can have table eggs the year round
at a reasonable price.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<span class="fs70">SELLING THE PRODUCT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have discussed the main points to be
considered in raising various poultry products
in this little booklet. However, much of our
success in the poultry business will depend on
our ability to obtain the top prices for our products
after we have raised them. In fact, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
is the cry all over the country now among the
farming population. The various agricultural
agencies that have heretofore spent considerable
time and effort in teaching the farmer to
raise a large quantity of good products, have
apparently accomplished this result, and now
these same agencies are trying to organize the
farmers into selling their products so that
they can receive a higher price for them.</p>

<p>The farmer usually has no time to devote to
the special marketing of his crop, as he is too
busy raising farm products, so attempts at co-operative
marketing have been made. There
have been many failures in this method in the
past, but now the farmer realizes that this system
is really his only salvation, and he is receiving
the idea of co-operation in a better mood
than he did in the past. However, for the one
living in town, with but a small flock of birds,
more time can usually be devoted to this end
of the business, with splendid returns. Many
town lot poultry keepers can sell all the eggs
that they can get just around to their neighbors,
who are usually glad to pay a little more
than the market price for the assurance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the eggs are strictly fresh. However, if one has
a fairly good yield of winter eggs, and is not
content to sell the eggs to his neighbors at
around market price, there are other methods
that can bring much higher returns.</p>

<p>Some poultry raisers get in touch with local
or neighboring hotels and restaurants, and agree
to let these parties have their entire output of
eggs at a certain margin above market price.
For instance, it is a common method to make
an agreement with such parties to sell them
their eggs at ten cents above market prices.
If the market quotations for fresh eggs were
thirty-two cents for a certain day, the hotel
keeper would pay forty-two cents, if the eggs
were delivered on this day. Usually, the restaurant
or hotel is glad to pay this premium
over the market price, because he takes quite
a chance with store eggs, in that some of them
are often stale, and this is a matter that reflects
against his business. Also, if such an
agreement can be made, the hotel or restaurant
man can advertise the fact that he serves nothing
but fresh eggs, which is good business for
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>When one is getting a big yield daily, he can
usually plan to sell his eggs by the case to city
commission men, who will always pay a good
premium over local markets. If one has not
enough eggs to sell a case once or twice weekly
in such a manner, this difficulty is often overcome
by combining with neighbors who are
willing to take the proper care in producing
clean, fresh eggs for market. However, such
neighbors must be in sympathy with what is
expected for fresh eggs, and who have the courage
to refrain from putting in eggs that are
not clean and fresh. If one case is sent in to
these commission men and the quality of the
eggs is not of first class, quite a dockage will
be deducted from the check, and your reputation
will thereby suffer. Never wash eggs that
are soiled, but use them in your own kitchen,
as the washing will remove the natural bloom,
or fine powder that is found on the untouched
egg. One can secure clean eggs by keeping the
bedding in the nests clean.</p>

<p>There is always a splendid opportunity to sell
hatching eggs in the spring of the year, if one
has had the foresight to get started in purebred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
poultry. There is always a large demand
for hatching eggs and most hatcheries can not
fill their orders. For the one engaged in the
poultry business, even on a small scale, this
offers a splendid opportunity, especially when
eggs are selling cheap on the market, as they
do in the spring of the year, to divide the mature
birds up into small pens of about ten females
to one good male bird, and sell these
eggs at anywhere from $1.50 a setting to as
much as you can get. The higher the quality
of the stock, the more money one can demand
for such hatching eggs.</p>

<p>Then there is another good source of revenue
from selling adult birds for breeding purposes.
If your flock is composed of good individuals,
you should experience little difficulty
in selling your surplus birds from $5 up.
A little well planned advertising is often a
good thing to do, to let people know what you
have got for sale. Often an advertisement in
the local paper, or a rural weekly will bring
in many inquiries in regard to the birds or
eggs that you have to sell.</p>

<p>Probably a cheaper way of advertising, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
really have good birds, is to show a pen, consisting
of four females and one male, at some
of the neighboring poultry shows. If you can
succeed in winning a premium, this will be a
splendid factor in your efforts in selling breeding
stock. It is usually permissible to place a
little card on the outside of your pen at the
poultry show, giving your name and address,
and stating that you have breeding stock for
sale, or that you are now taking orders for
hatching eggs in the spring.</p>

<p>I have tried to explain in this little booklet
that there is a splendid opportunity for one to
engage in the poultry industry, whether it be
on a large scale, or a small scale. There is considerable
pleasure as well as profit in this
work, for the one that is posted on a few of the
essential principles, as has been laid down in
this short treatise. It will probably be well to
repeat a few facts that should be remembered
first, however, before closing.</p>

<p>Do not expect to make a great amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
money from your poultry the first year. Getting
started right in the poultry business will
cost something, so for the first year, if you
just break even you will do well. Plan to
learn as you go along. Every poultry raiser
should take at least one poultry journal, to
keep posted on the latest facts concerning the
business. These journals always carry a great
amount of advertising matter in regard to
stock for breeding and in regard to poultry
house equipment, etc. Many useful ideas can
be secured from pretty near every issue of a
standard paper.</p>

<p>Get acquainted with the other poultry people
in your own locality. This is especially true in
regard to those who have the same breed that
you have. If your locality boasts of a poultry
association, become a member of this association.
You can then get much valuable information
in regard to your business.</p>

<p>Get in touch with your state agricultural
college, and especially with the poultry department.
Write to them and ask them to send you
all the bulletins that they have published on
poultry, and tell them to place you on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
mailing list, so that any future bulletins that
they may publish will be sent you free of
charge. Then the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture
has many excellent bulletins on different
branches of the poultry industry that are worth
sending for. It is located at Washington, D.
C. Another splendid thing, if you can succeed
in interesting others in your community, would
be to send to the Motion Picture Lab., U. S.
Dept. of Agriculture, Wash., D. C., and have
them send you their film on culling, entitled,
“Select the Laying Hen.” It certainly brings
out in a splendid manner, just how to cull your
flock. Most any moving picture house would
be glad to run this reel free of charge. The
only expense of securing this film is the transportation
charges from Washington, D. C., to
your home town.</p>

<p>With these parting words on the betterment
of your flock, remember that poultry work has
its ups and downs, like any other business.
However, for one willing to inform himself on
the business, a very pleasurable and profitable
experience may be anticipated.</p>
